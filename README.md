# D3-Challenge
AKA bet my boss I could do the same challenge our front-end web dev job candidates were doing

borrowed this: https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063423
And ultimately this: https://bl.ocks.org/kerryrodden/7090426
And hooked it up to my own data in a csv (or nested json) and edited for company colors. 

didn't do that much. Still fun though!
